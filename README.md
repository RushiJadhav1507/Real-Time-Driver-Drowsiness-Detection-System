# Real-Time-Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
1) The objective of this intermediate Python project is to build a drowsiness detection system that will detect that a personâ€™s eyes are closed for a few seconds. This system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.
2) A countless number of people drive on the highway day and night. Taxi drivers,bus drivers, truck drivers and people traveling long-distance suffer from lack of
sleep.Due to which it becomes very dangerous to drive when feeling sleepy.The majority of accidents happen due to the drowsiness of the driver.Drowsiness detection is a safety technology that can prevent accidents that are caused by drivers who fell asleep while driving.
3) The major aim of this project is to develop a drowsiness detection system bymonitoring the eyes. It is believed that the symptoms of driver fatigue can be detected early enough to avoid a car accident. In such a case when drowsiness is detected, a warning signal is issued to alert the driver. This detection system provides a noncontact technique for judging different levels of driver alertness and facilitates early detection of a decline in alertness during driving. In such a case when fatigue is detected, a warning signal is issued to alert the driver. The system also can have additional feature of slowing down the vehicle if driver fails to respond to the alarm and ultimately stops the vehicle.
